Before1 and After1:
Shows the two bytes 00000000 00000000 being written before and after the speedup trick (showing about a 25% improvement in speed to write the same two bytes). This is an ideal scenerio, and the improvement is unlikley to be this significant in real world.


Before2 and After2:
Shows the two bytes 00000001 01011101 being written (SPI library set in the now funcitonal second edge mode) before and after the speedup trick. This is a more real world scenerio and shows the speedup around 10%.
